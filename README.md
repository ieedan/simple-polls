# simple-polls

A simple app to create polls built in SvelteKit.

## How it works

Users vote by either upvoting or downvoting a poll. Polls are 100% anonymous meaning other users can't see polls you create or your vote in the poll. You can however keep track of polls you created or participated in.

If you like **simple-polls** give it an upvote in this [Poll](https://simple-polls.vercel.app/polls/rec_cq79bp5c8vb7p5u0n0og)!
